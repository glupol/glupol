- 👋 Hi, I’m Grzegorz (Greg | Kot) @glupol 
- 👀 I’m interested in c/c++, asembler languages, GPGPU.. but it's a bit old story. Now I'm working with python and all the ML things-people-do-this-days.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pytorch with its ecosystem for medical imaging (MRI for Cardiac imaging)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might be cool and interesting.
